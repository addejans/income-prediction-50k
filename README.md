# income-prediction-50k
Basic application for deploying an income prediction model.

Application is deployed at: https://income-prediction-50k.herokuapp.com/

## This is a simple deployment of a decision tree classification model (trained via scikit-learn) to make an income prediction (over or under $50k USD).
#### What is the importance of this project?
  - Deployment is often an overlooked phase from many theoretical data scientists.
  - In order to start using a model for practical decision-making, it needs to be effectively deployed into production. If you cannot reliably get practical insights from your model, then the impact of the model is severely limited.
  - In order to get the most value out of machine learning models, it is important to seamlessly deploy them into production so a business can start using them to make practical decisions.
